## Why are we doing this?
The objective for this project is to demonstrate the coding and project/product management
skills learned during the QA DFESW10 Software Development course. The project should 
demonstrate the ability to create a backend program with full CRUD (create, read, update, 
delete) functionality using the skills and tools that were taught over the previous 
8 weeks (e.g. Spring, Java, Git and GitHub, Jira etc.).

## How I expected the challenge to go.
I am currently unsure how well I'm going to do at the coding, especially when it comes to 
the testing. However, I have extensive notes and will be referring to Google for help 
if/when I need it! - CJC 15:30 04/03/2022.  

I did not expect the project to go completely smoothly but I did think I would be fine with 
using Jira and Git/GitHub. I knew I would struggle with the coding, especially when it came 
to the testing stages. 

I expected my time-management and documentation to go reasonably well. 

## What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
I feel that my Jira use went well. I added a few extra elements such as acceptance criteria 
lists to each of my backlog issues and tried to use them as I went to ensure I was covering
all the required elements.

I am disappointed in the way my use of Git/GitHub turned out. I thought I was using feature
branches appropriately but it seems perhaps there were times when I did not merge a feature
into the Develop branch before creating the next feature branch. This lead to some merge
issues. However, it did help me find out a few extra Git commands, such as git stash, when 
I discovered I had started coding whilst on the wrong branch and wanted to stash all the 
changes I'd made, switch branch and then retrieve the stashed changes. My use of Git/GitHub 
may not have been ideal but I feel I have learnt and just require more practice to ensure
a reliable workflow in future.

## Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
Completing full unit testing would be the first priority and perhaps refactoring to ensure
good readability throughout.

I would like to add more custom search options as there is currently only search by ID and
search by title. I would like to add an option to search but only return entries that are
suitable for the user's age, i.e. if a user is under 18 they would not be shown any entries
that had an 18 rating. 

I would also like to add different levels of access for creating and altering entries,
e.g. have an admin status and a non-admin user status to add some protectection to the stored
data. This would require the use of another table in the database to store user information.

## Screenshots showing your postman requests and the output from the API.

## Screenshots of your database to prove that data is being persisted.
