## Why are we doing this?
The ojective for this project is to demonstrate the coding and project/product management
skills learned during the QA DFESW10 Software Development course. The project should 
demonstrate the ability to create a backend program with full CRUD (create, read, update, 
delete) functionality using the skills and tools that were taught over the previous 
8 weeks (e.g. Spring, Java, Git and GitHub, Jira etc.).

## How I expected the challenge to go.
I am currently unsure how well I'm going to do at the coding, especially when it comes to 
the testing. However, I have extensive notes and will be referring to Google for help 
if/when I need it! - CJC 15:30 04/03/2022.
